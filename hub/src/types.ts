// ── Tiered gossip hierarchy ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Replaces the old flat top-5 "everyone dials the same relays" roster,
// which doesn't scale (RELAY_ROSTER_SIZE=5 × MAX_MESH_PEERS on the client
// meant only ~100 total lightnodes could ever hold a P2P slot — everyone
// past that fell back to hitting Vercel/the validator/the archive
// directly, defeating the point). Instead, ALL scored nodes are ranked by
// the same score() function and sliced into 5 tiers, each node getting
// exactly ONE parent to dial (not a menu of candidates):
//   Leader (rank 0, 1 node)              — parent: null, talks to Railway directly
//   Guardian (rank 1-20, 20)             — parent: the Leader
//   Broadcaster (rank 21-420, 400)       — parent: one of the 20 Guardians
//   Vision (rank 421-8420, 8000)         — parent: one of the 400 Broadcasters
//   Echo (rank 8421-168420, 160000)      — parent: one of the 8000 Visions
//   none (rank 168421+, or not yet scored) — parent: null, falls back to
//     Railway/archive/validator directly same as today, until scored in
//     on a future rescore
// A new block flows Leader → its 20 Guardians → their 400 Broadcasters →
// their 8000 Visions → their 160000 Echoes, 4 WebRTC hops covering up to
// ~168421 nodes instead of however many thousand all hitting
// Railway/Vercel independently. Railway holds the whole tree structure in
// memory (see telemetry map) since it computed it — nodes don't need to

// (see RelayStatsMessage) are ever listed here — browser Light Nodes
// never qualify, since they don't retain full history to serve.
//
// Railway's role is strictly a blind relay for the request/response pair
// (same pattern as webrtc_offer/answer below) — it never inspects or

// sampleBootstrapPeers() in server.ts) biased toward nodes with a proven
// participation history, so a swarm of throwaway connections can't dominate
// the sample a new node receives. Railway sends BootstrapPeersMessage
